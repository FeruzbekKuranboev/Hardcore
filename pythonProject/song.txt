In the quiet of the night, dreams take flight
Stars are shining bright, guiding us through the light.
With every heartbeat, we chase the dawn,
Together we'll stand strong, until the night is gone.

Through winding roads and endless skies,  
We'll rise above, where the eagle flies.  
With hope in our hearts and fire in our soul,  
We'll journey on, to reach our goal.
